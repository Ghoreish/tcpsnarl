A Python script to listen on port 10942 and forward any single-line
messages it gets to a locally-running Snarl install.

Dependencies
============

tcpsnarl requires either ctypes (included in Python 2.5) or pywin32.

You will of course need Snarl: http://www.fullphat.net/

Usage
=====

Change LISTEN_IP to the network interface you want to listen on, then
run tcpsnarl.py.

To send a message from a Linux box:

  echo "this is a test" | nc 192.168.0.1 10942

I do this inside a colinux VM that runs on my Windows XP laptop.
